This is a small ETL project inspired by ankitbansal6, but with my own tweaks and small additions. 

Extract phase consists of getting the data from a CSV file and then appending it to the SQL Server

Transform phase consists of cleaning, converting types, populating missing values and dealing with the ones that cant be populated

Load phase consists of SQL queries that answer specific questions for this data. For the next project I will probably load the results into a dashboard
